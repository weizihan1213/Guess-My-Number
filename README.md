# Guess-My-Number

A side-project that I created with the instructor of the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert" on Udemy. It's a game project related to guessing numbers, that a random number will be automatically generated within the range of 1 to 20 when the game starts. There're 20 points for the game in all, meaning that players will lose one point each time if the wrong number is chosen, and the game will be over when they lose all. Also, based off of the value that is greater or less, the hint will be given correspondingly. The project is implemented by using HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, and DOM API.
